# waterpouring

A possible solution to the water pouring problem.

The water pouring problem is:

Given a number of glasses of different capacities and the moves:

    * Fill - fill a glass to capacity
    * Empty - empty a glass completely
    * Pour - pour from one glass to another without spilling potentially
       leaving any water that can't be contained in one glass in the
       other.

What is the smallest number of moves required to achieve a glass with
a target volume of water in it given that the target volume doesn't
exceed the maximum volume of the largest glass.
